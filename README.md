This a repository for my **BA Human Geography with Quantitative Methods** dissirtation (2016). The project serves as a case study for studing physical activity in the context of air pollution in urban areas. Activity data acquired from Strava were contrasted with air quality data for London in order to establish optimal running routes. 

All scripts utilised in the research can be found in _R_ folder. Due to sensitivity of the utilised data, physical activity records collected from Strava are not available. The final report is attached in a pdf document entitled _"Dissertation.pdf"_. High resolution figures featured in the thesis can be found in _plots_ folder.
